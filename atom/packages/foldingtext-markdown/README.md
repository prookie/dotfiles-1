# foldingtext-markdown package

Edit Markdown in the [FoldingText for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/foldingtext-for-atom) outliner.

## This is a work in progress

It's not yet a complete solution. I'm offering it as a starting point for interested people to test out and see the general direction that Markdown editing in FoldingText for Atom will take.

## Getting Started

This package contains:

- Commands to copy an outline as Markdown and paste Markdown as an outline.

- Commands for setting Markdown `data-type`s on items. CommonMark AST type names are used for `data-type` values. Example types include `Header`, `CodeBlock`, `Ordered`, etc.

- Style rules making those types visible in the outline editor.
