Select the _Install_ section on the left, hit the _Themes_ button and search for `Base16` in the search box. Click on _Install_ on the Base16 Syntax card.\n\nAlternatively, open a terminal and type in:\n\n```\napm install base16-syntax\n```\n\n## Enable Base16 Syntax\n\nBase16 Syntax can be enabled by going to the _Settings_ view (<kbd>Ctrl + ,</kbd>). Select the _Themes_ section on the left side and choose _Base16_ from the _Syntax Theme_ drop down menu.\n\n## Change the default theme\n\nThe `Default (Light)` syntax theme is loaded when using a light UI theme and the `Default (Dark)` syntax theme is loaded when using a dark UI theme or when a dark or light UI theme could not be detected.\n\nThe theme can be changed by choosing a different `scheme` or `style` from the drop down menu in the `Base16 Syntax` _Settings_ view.\n\nAlternatively, the theme can be changed in the Preview Mode. Toggle the _Command Palette_ (<kbd>Ctrl + Shift + P</kbd>). Type in `Base16 Syntax: Select Theme` and choose another theme from the list. While browsing through the list of available themes a live preview of each selected theme is automatically applied to all open files.\n\nNote: by default, only the styles matching the UI theme are shown in the Preview Mode, i.e. only dark styles are shown when using a dark UI theme and only light styles are shown when using a light UI theme. This can be disabled by going to the `Base16 Syntax` _Settings_ view and uncheck `Match User Interface Theme`.\n\n## Credits\n\nThe original [Base16 Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) is made by [Chris Kempson](http://chriskempson.com).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/alchiadus/base16-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/alchiadus/base16-syntax","_id":"base16-syntax@1.5.0","_shasum":"9e94b4c452036f99622e68600a4d373f6a265e75","_resolved":"file:../d-115626-6901-7qtlaj/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115626-6901-7qtlaj/package.tgz"}
